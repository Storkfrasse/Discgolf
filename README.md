Discgolf is a big hobby of mine, and the idea for my website is to make people understand the orgin of discgolf and the fun in the game.
I wanted to create a website that has the ability to grow as i grow with the sport. I want to show through pictures the beautiful nature of the sport.
Discgolf is a site for everyone who want to know more about the sport. And it's more like a discgolf blog for my experience and others.
