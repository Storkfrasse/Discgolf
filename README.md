Discgolf has three pages. The [home page](index.html) is the default loading page, [gallery](gallery.html) and [contact](contact.html) pages are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The fonts chosen were 'Oswald' for the headings and 'Lato' for the body text.  
     *  'Oswald' was chosen for the headings because i thought i was the best as a heading font. it bold and looks good
      * 'Lato' is used for the body text as it provides a nice contrast to the cursive whilst being easy to read for all.

 * ### Colour Scheme
      I used black and white as a colour scheme for Discgolf. i want to keep it simple and easy for the eyes.
