        <h2>What is discgolf?</h2>
            <p>Discgolf, also known as Frisbee golf, is a sport that combines elements of traditional golf with throwing a flying disc
            (frisbee) into a series of target baskets or holes in as few throws as possible. The objective of disc golf is to
            complete a course, typically consisting of 9 or 18 holes, in as few throws as possible, similar to traditional golf
            where players aim to complete a course in as few strokes as possible.
        <br>
        <br>
        Discgolf was invented in the 1960s. The exact origin and the person responsible for its invention are subjects of some debate,
        but the game's development is often attributed to multiple individuals who were experimenting with throwing flying discs
        (Frisbees) into designated targets, much like traditional golf.
        
        One commonly cited early disc golf course was established in 1965 at Oak Grove Park in Pasadena, California. The sport
        grew in popularity throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, leading to the establishment of more courses and the
        formalization of rules.
        
        Overall, disc golf's origins can be traced back to the 1960s, and it has since become a popular recreational and
        competitive activity worldwide.</p>
